# GraphAlgorithms-Python

Personal Project

## Description

I have implemented solutions to all major graph problems variations in Python (topological 
sort, shortest path, minimum spanning tree) while using a base class representation of a
graph with abstract methods, having adjacency matrix and set graph representations as 
subclassses and an imported priority dictionary class functioning as a priority queue to map
edge pairs to their respective weights (named 'priorities').
